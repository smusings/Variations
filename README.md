Variations was my attempt to learn how to integrate third party software with my own personal code. I used Google Maps V2 API to display the map of the area around me. I then utalized the Factual Java Driver (https://github.com/Factual/factual-java-driver) to request the nearest 25 restaurant locations, sorted from closest to farthest.

Factual also provided me with phone numbers, distance, addresses of these places.
